- `Intune-All-App-Assignments.csv`
- `Intune-Selected-App-Details.csv`

> These are saved to the current user’s **Desktop** by default.

## 📌 Tips

- App names do **partial match**, so `Excel` matches `Excel 365`.
- Assignments respect **Graph API limits**, so large tenants may take a few minutes.
- `Stop` button is responsive and halts processing immediately.

---

## 🔧 Customization Ideas

- Add filtering by **App Type** (e.g., `Win32`, `iOS`).
- Add logging to a file (e.g., `C:\Logs\IntuneAssignmentTool.log`).
- Add profile-based configuration saving for repeatable operations.

## 📎 Sample Use Case

### Scenario: Add a group `Finance Users` to all apps containing `Office`
- Enter `Finance Users` in the group name field.
- Enter `Office` in the app name filter.
- Click `➕ Add Inclusion (Selected Apps)`.
